<p>This is the user guide for Stack Manager. It will run through all the basic concepts with you.</p>
<p>
This is the starting screen for Stack Manager. From here you can perform every action. Right now we will add to warehouse stack.

We will call this crate "bananas" and click add to add it to the stack.

The warehouse stack now has our crate on it. From here we can move the crate to any of the other stacks by selecting "Move from warehous stack".

Now we select "Add Crate 1" for the first Store we want to add a crate to, and "Add Crate 2" for the the second. Note that both of these radio buttons must be selected. We then click "MOVE" to move the crate.

The crate will have been split and moved with the appropriate stacks updated.

Once we have added enough crates to a stack we may wish to ship these crates to the store. To accomplish we click "Ship".

Now the crate has shipped and the stack is empty.
